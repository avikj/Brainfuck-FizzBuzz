# Brainfuck-FizzBuzz
Probably not the best way to write FizzBuzz.

## About
This is my attempt to implement a solution to the classic FizzBuzz problem in the esoteric language Brainfuck.

Brainfuck is a language based on an array of bytes, which can be manipulated using only 8 commands, to increment/decrement, 
move to an adjacant position in the array, loop while the current byte doesn't store 0, get a char of input, and print.

The extremely limited functionality given by the Brainfuck language makes solving a simple problem like FizzBuzz require complex algorithms.

More thorough description of Brainfuck on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

## Running

To actually run/test this program, I used an [online Brainfuck interpreter](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/).
